# Order Tracking Incremental Load Project

The **Order Tracking Incremental Load Project** is a comprehensive data processing and integration solution built using Apache Spark in Databricks. This project is designed with the primary goal of efficiently handling and processing order tracking data while seamlessly incorporating incremental updates into a target dataset. The integration process involves fetching, processing, and seamlessly integrating data from a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket into Delta tables within the Databricks environment.

## Key Features

### Stage Processing

- **Data Extraction:** CSV files are fetched from the specified GCS bucket's input folder.
- **Data Transformation:** The extracted data undergoes processing to meet integration requirements, ensuring its readiness for further stages.
- **Staging Delta Table:** Processed data finds a home in a staging Delta table within Databricks, serving as a robust intermediary for subsequent processing.

### Target Processing

- **Upsert Functionality:** The project employs the upsert (merge) operation to efficiently update the target Delta table with incremental data from the staging Delta table.
- **Data Integration:** Ensures the target Delta table consistently reflects the most up-to-date and accurate order tracking information.

### Automation

- **Scheduled Execution:** Notebooks are scheduled for automated execution, providing a seamless and efficient data loading process.
- **Optimized Performance:** Automation plays a crucial role in maintaining consistency and performance during data updates.

### GCP Integration

- **Google Cloud Storage:** Leverages GCS as a reliable and scalable storage solution for handling input data.
- **Secure Authentication:** Integrates with GCP using a service account JSON key, ensuring secure authentication.

## Project Structure

The project is well-organized into notebooks and scripts, facilitating easy navigation and execution within a Databricks environment.

- **Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks containing code for stage processing, target processing, and automation scheduling.
- **Scripts:** Additional scripts that may be utilized in the project.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- Databricks environment with Apache Spark installed.
- Access to a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket for input data.
- Service account JSON key for GCP authentication.
- Properly configured Delta tables in Databricks for staging and target processing.
